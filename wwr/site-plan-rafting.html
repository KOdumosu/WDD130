        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>Rafting is a competitive sport in which the objective is to navigate downstream on river rapids using an inflated
            raft. It is an extreme sport that is highly challenging and risky, and requires a great deal of teamwork.
        
            The following breakdown are considered the purpose of water rafting :
        
            Builds confidence to boost self-esteem:
            White water river rafting trips help you gain confidence because it leaves you with a sense of accomplishment. You
            have no other option but to stop thinking about any other thing and concentrate only on overcoming intimidating
            water waves and rafting.
        
            Improves strength:
            Whitewater river rafting is physically challenging because you need to use your upper body to paddle through the
            waters. It, in the process, strengthens your back, shoulders, arms, core, and even your thinking abilities. And as
            you will be paddling for long hours at a stretch on a trip, rafters need the endurance to be able to do it. White
            water rafting excursions are between 90 minutes and 2 hours on the River and offer a full-fledged cardio workout.
            Cardio helps burn fat and calories and also increases your lung size and heart muscle levels. Paddling also
            increases lung capacity, improves heart and lungs strength so that you burn more calories. You can, in fact, easily
            burn more than 800 calories a day with the physical exercise in whitewater rafting trips.
        
            Reduces stress:
            White water rafting reduces cortisol, the body's main stress hormone. Many studies suggest reduced stress can cause
            improved brain function, enhanced energy, and reduced body irritability. It's been scientifically proven that being
            outdoors in the fresh air helps your mental health and stress levels much more than any indoor activity. The
            endorphins released reduce not only stress but also increase your concentration levels. You end up feeling more
            confident about solving any problems you face. Besides, the physical activity of whitewater rafting triggers the
            growth of new brain cells to help reduce the signs of aging.
        
            Creates an adrenaline rush and elevates moods:
            Navigating the water, through all its turns and rapids, creates a thrill for adventure, which increases your
            adrenaline levels. It also helps you focus more on the fun side of the activity than the heavier addling. The scenic
            locations also satiate your taste for adventure by inducing a positive perspective on nature exploration. The
            outdoor adventure keeps rafters out in the sunlight for a long time, which elevates your mood. According to
            research, all it takes is about 150 minutes of sunlight every day to reduce the effects of depression. So imagine
            how beneficial 2 hours of whitewater rafting outdoors in nature is to your mental health! Sunlight exposure fills
            you with Vitamin D, an essential nutrient. Vitamin D is important for so many body processes like managing calcium
            levels, reducing swelling, and supporting glucose metabolism and strong bones. Vitamin D also improves sleep and
            with a good night's sleep, your mind feels rested. You find it easier to make connections about whatever you learn
            through the day, thus boosting your intelligence. Besides, sleeping gives your brain the required time to balance
            out the hormones and chemicals that affect your mood and mental activities. In short, a whitewater river rafting
            trip is definitely a better way than sitting at home or cooped up at the office. Spending time outdoors in the raft
            allows you to connect profoundly with your inner self and escape technological disobedience. In return, you enjoy a
            peaceful moment, especially when you raft in the outdoor sereneness, quiet, and relaxing surroundings. Being out in
            nature is a great way to increase your health and life. And in the process, reap the many health benefits of white
            water rafting trips.</p>
